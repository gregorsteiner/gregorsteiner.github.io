I am a second-year PhD student at the University of Warwick, supervised by [Prof. Mark Steel](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/steel/). My research focuses on causal inference and model uncertainty, with a strong emphasis on Bayesian methods. My motivation primarily stems from applications in economics and biomedicine.

Before starting my PhD, I earned a BSc and MSc in Economics from WU Vienna and a BSc in Statistics from the University of Vienna. While completing my studies, I worked at the Centre for Medical Data Science at the Medical University of Vienna, where I developed and maintained statistical software.
