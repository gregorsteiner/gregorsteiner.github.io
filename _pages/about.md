I am a first-year PhD student at the University of Warwick, supervised by [Prof. Mark Steel](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/steel/). My research focuses on causal inference and model uncertainty, with a strong emphasis on Bayesian methods. I am particularly interested in how model selection techniques can be used to relax causal assumptions. For example, my current work explores Bayesian model averaging in instrumental variable models. My motivation primarily stems from applications in economics and biomedicine.

Before starting my PhD, I earned a BSc and MSc in Economics from WU Vienna and a BSc in Statistics from the University of Vienna. During this time, I gained valuable experience working at the Centre for Medical Data Science at the Medical University of Vienna, where I developed and maintained statistical software.
