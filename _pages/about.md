I am a PhD student at the University of Warwick, supervised by [Mark Steel](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/steel/). My research focuses on causal inference and model uncertainty, with a strong emphasis on Bayesian (and post-Bayesian) methods. I am particularly interested in making causal inference more robust by explicitly accounting for uncertainty in causal assumptions. My motivation primarily stems from applications in economics.

I am currently visiting Nanyang Technological University Singapore, hosted by [Jeremie Houssineau](https://jeremiehoussineau.com/), where I am working on epistemic uncertainty in causal inference.

Before starting my PhD, I earned a BSc and MSc in Economics from WU Vienna and a BSc in Statistics from the University of Vienna. While completing my studies, I worked at the Centre for Medical Data Science at the Medical University of Vienna, where I developed and maintained statistical software.
